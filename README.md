Enhancing Facial Recognition through Optical Vanderlugt Filters: A Simulation Study in the Spatial Frequency Domain
This study explores the application of optical correlation techniques for simulating human-face identification in the spatial frequency domain. Focusing on the effectiveness of optical Vanderlugt filters, MATLAB-based simulations are conducted using the ORL dataset, which includes images of 40 subjects in 10 poses. The emphasis is on the theoretical and computational effectiveness of optical correlation methods, rather than real-world applications. The simulation process achieves an approximate face recognition accuracy of 82%. These findings enhance our understanding of optical image processing capabilities, potentially advancing biometric security technologies.
